# Overview

I created a unity game that allows users to enjoy a few moments as the First Avenger. The game uses sprites, scripts, and compenents to allow the game to run. The game allowes horizontal movement and a small amount of vertical. The users may "throw his shield" horizontally by pressing 'f'.

I designed this game because I thought it would be a fun project and would give me practice customizing a program to meet certain standards.
